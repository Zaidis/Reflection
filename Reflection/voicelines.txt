*ahem* Hello, and welcome to Alprire. We box things! 

What kinds of things you might ask? Anything that fits inside a box, and sometimes things that don't.

Anywho, I'm Frank Harrison, the CEO and majority shareholder of Alpire. AKA, I'm the one in charge. 

It is my pleasure to have you here in my facility. I hope you enjoy the tour! The tour guide should be with you all soon.

Man do I love boxes. Reflecting back on my life, boxes have always been there for me. 

Over here we have our training area. What? You think you can just show up and become an employee. HA. 

I don't like the term "interns." I prefer "determined boxing agents."

Welcome to our state of the art human waste disposal area. 

Three toilets equals triple disposal efficiency!

Oh and wash your hands. Seriously.

If you are an employee, welcome to the closet behind the stairs!

If you are not an employee, please stay here. A security guard will come over and throw you outside.
