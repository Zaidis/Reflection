*ahem* Hello, and welcome to Alprire. We box things! 

What kinds of things you might ask? Anything that fits inside a box, and sometimes things that don't.

Anywho, I'm Frank Harrison, the CEO and majority shareholder of Alpire. AKA, I'm the one in charge. 

It is my pleasure to have you here in my facility. I hope you enjoy the tour! The tour guide should be with you all soon.




----------------------------------------

Man do I love boxes. Reflecting back on my life, boxes have always been there for me. 

Over here we have our training area. What? You think you can just show up and become an employee. HA. 

I don't like the term "interns." I prefer "determined boxing agents."

----------------------------------------

Welcome to our state of the art human waste disposal area. 

Three toilets equals triple disposal efficiency!

Oh and wash your hands. Seriously. 

----------------------------------------

If you are an employee, welcome to the closet behind the stairs!

If you are not an employee, please stay here. A security guard will come over and throw you outside. 

----------------------------------------

Welcome Authorized Personnel. If this is your first time here, you're lucky. Not just anyone is allowed inside. 

Just to be clear, this does not mean you are allowed to walk into my office. My office, my rules. 

Unless of course I gave you the keycode. Then that means I trust you.

Whoever listens to this, hello. I am Frank Harrison, and I made this little recording as a fairwell. If you are hearing this,
I am probably dead. What lives on from me will live on in Alpire. Reflecting back on my life, it has always been a dream to
build a business, and I carried that out. It fills me with joy hearing about our customer's satisfaction when a box arrives
to their front door, or when we help those who need ways to carry their objects. We make lives easier and more efficient.
In a way, our boxes have...changed the world. Boxes are the future, and I believe it's time to start acknowledging the truth. 
I have treated all of our boxes with respect, dignity, and treated them as family. It is time more people start following that example.
